# Github Repository Search App
This repository hosts the source code for a web application that allows users to search for GitHub users and their repositories. The application is built with Next.js - a full stack React framework with TypeScript on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. The backend utilises the GitHub v4 API which implements GraphQL in order to fetch users and their repositories by username.

3. Install an IDE on your device. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended. 
4. Launch the IDE and open a safe folder to store the repository codebase.
5. Open the terminal and clone the repository with the command
```git clone  https://github.com/mctechspot/GithubRepositorySearchApp```
6. Enter the app directory with the following command:
